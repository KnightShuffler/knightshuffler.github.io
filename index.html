    Through my computer science degree, I never really paid attention to my
    courses on web development which is why I'm glad I found out about Jekyll
    and GitHub pages. Now I can easily make a website for free that
    <i>nobody</i> will ever visit.

    That being said, for any of you who got lost looking for good blogs on
    GitHub:
    <blockquote cite="Me">
        Hi, I'm Swagat and I suck at introducing myself, welcome to my website.
    </blockquote>
    I wanted to make a place to document the things I've learnt and somehow
    thought this was a good idea.<br>
    Since you've already made it here, why not explore a little?
