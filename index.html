<h1>About Me</h1>
<span style="font-size: smaller;">
<p>
    I am a computer science graduate with an interest in theoretical computer
    science, physics and game development.
</p>
<p>
    I started programming in C++ when I was in high school, motivated to make my
    own video games. At the end of 12th grade, I made my first game prototype
    entirely from scratch: <i>Swine Flew</i>. It was a simple side-scrolling
    game where the player controlled a flying pig trying to reach the end of the
    level while avoiding obstacles.
</p>
<p>
    Going to university, I was able to explore my interests further. Through
    writing shaders for games, I learned how to use program GPUs to train neural
    networks. And, my appreciation for physics led me to start studying quantum
    computing.
</p>
<p>
    I usually work in C++ and I'm also familiar with Python, C and Java.
