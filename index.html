<h2>About Me</h2>
<span style="font-size: smaller;">
<p>
    I am a computer science graduate with an interest in quantum computing,
    theoretical computer science and computer graphics.
</p>
<p>
    Being able to make my own video games was the only motivation I needed to
    learn how to program. From tinkering with Game Maker to my computer science
    classes in high school where I learned C++, I had learned enough to make my
    first game entirely from scratch. <i>Swine Flew</i> was a simple horizontal
    side-scroller where the player controls a flying pig.
</p>
<p>
    Since then, I have dabbled in graphics programming in OpenGL and GPGPU
    programming in CUDA.
