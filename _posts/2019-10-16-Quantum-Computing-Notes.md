excerpt: "New website section for my quantum computing notes is live!"

I finally finished setting up the website's section for sharing my quantum
computing notes. You can use the navigation bar at the top to access it or
[click here](/quantum-notes/).

Quantum computing has been a topic that's interested me ever since I watched
[Kurzgesagt's video](https://youtu.be/JhHMJCUmq28) on the topic, mid-way through
my undergraduate career. I followed my interest and over the course of a few
years, managed to read many books and attend a few courses about this bizarre
world of computation.

My notebooks, somehow, always find a way to teleport to a random universe after
spending a few months in my care, so I decided to transcribe my notes and put
them online before they run off this time. It'll be quite a task to put all my
notes here but, I'll try to get at least one section up every week, so stay
tuned for future updates!
