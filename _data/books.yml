    Cited by many as the bible for quantum computing, this was the first book
    on the subject I bought. Going through it isn't a simple task, my notes
    can't be seen as a replacement for actually reading through it yourself. I
    used the 10th Anniversary edition of the book.

#     As you could guess from the title, this book addresses the topic of quantum
#     computing from the perspective of a computer scientist. I used the kindle
#     edition of the book.

#     Not a <i>standard</i> textbook like the others in the list so far, this is a
#     fun yet taxing read. It covers a lot without getting too far into the
#     technicalities of quantum computing.
